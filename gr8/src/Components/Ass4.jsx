            <h id="topic">Requirements:</h>
            <p id="description-list">
                • Compiler that can be used to create and edit code over time<br />
                • Database where information can be effetively read from<br />
                • Efficient algorithm that can allow for fast web scraping<br />
                • Jupyter or IDE of equivalent prevalence 
                </p>

            <br /> 

            <h3 id="subject">Design Approach:</h3>
            <p id="description-list">
                • Begin by becoming more familiar with Python IDE's<br /> 
                • Create a test software that can read text from a specific source<br /> 
                • Fabricate a database where information can be stored and read from<br /> 
                • Connect the database with a software that can be used to submit information<br /> 
                • Work with Python to implement web scraping<br /> 
                • Implement an algorithm that analyzes text submitted to the database<br /> 
                • Program a method that depicts emotions based on language used in database submissions 
                </p>
            <br /> 

            <h3 id="subject">Design Objectives:</h3>
            <p id="description-list">
                • Make our software very intuitive and easy to use in order for people of all ages and backgrounds to use it<br />
                • Enable users to change and customize the software in anyway that they want to find the best results  <br />
                • Efficiently produce outputs based on huge datasets that would not slow down the users machine alot <br />
                • Correctly output results based on real world data using our designed algorithms <br />
                </p>
            <br /> 

            <h3 id="subject">Attributes:</h3>
            <p id="description-list">
            • Reliably display the correct information that the customer requestes from the software <br />
            • Make the software easy to scale to make it possible for hundreds or more users to use it at the same time, while still being efficient  <br />
            • The software should have good portability to be used on any operating system and device<br />
            • The users should be able to resue the software in many differt ways and applications <br />
            • Reliably display the correct information that the customer requests from the software <br />

            
                </p>
            <br /> 

            <h3 id="subject">Paths to Avoid:</h3>
            <p id="description-list">
            • Manually analyzing the given data as the program should be automatic.<br />
            • Creating an app version as the program should only work in the web browser.<br />
            • Neglecting to create a satisfying minimum viable product.<br />
            • Cluttering the webpage with intrusive advertisements.<br />
            • Not updating the code frequently enough.<br />
            • Underestimating how much it would cost to develop the program and host the webpage.<br />
            • Ignoring customer feedback and criticism.<br />
