                •Begin by becoming more familiar with Python IDE's<br /> 
                •Create a test software that can read text from a specific source<br /> 
                •Fabricate a database where information can be stored and read from<br /> 
                •Connect the database with a software that can be used to submit information<br /> 
                •Work with Python to implement web scraping<br /> 
                •Implement an algorithm that analyzes text submitted to the database<br /> 
                •Program a method that depicts emotions based on language used in database submissions
