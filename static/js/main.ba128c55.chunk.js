Specifically the group wishes to use the twitter and facebook API to discern how people feel about topics such as the 2022 winter olympics, Russia/Ukraine conflict, and trucker blockade. Companies could also use this information to make or alter major decisions. Recently many gaming companies and celebrities have announced their support for NFTs before retracting these statements. Movie studios could find out whether their advertisements have left a positive or negative impact on their target demographics. Consumers could find out how other people feel about a certain brand when deciding whether or not to buy a product. The possibilities for a well designed sentiment analysis application are nearly limitless."),r.a.createElement("h3",{id:"subject"},"Objective: "),r.a.createElement("p",{id:"description"},"This can allow the feelings of the general public regarding a specific topic to be easily exposed, allowing for a simple method of determining how invested they are in the subject, and what actions would best suit their perspectives. This kind of software would be very useful to big companies, such as Netflix, movie studios, etc. in order to have a better gauge of how their products are doing; instead of searching through surveys and multiple other sites. In addition, regular people rarely buy an item without first reading reviews, oftentimes to get the best reviews or opinions on different matters they would have to search on different sites. Our objective is therefore to make a simple solution to make all of these sentimental values in one space and easy to use."),r.a.createElement("h3",{id:"subject"},"Background: "),r.a.createElement("p",{id:"description"},"Our application would use APIs from current social media platforms and gather information from other sites and put it all together in one program that would enable customers and businesses to easily see the response of their products and make decisions without wasting time by visiting multiple sites.

On the other hand  if companies use this software to gauge the reception of their products there should be ways to organize the data to make it easy to read and understand.

As this effort would be software-based, material cost is not a concern. If the group were to use a website for this software, we would need to host it on a server somewhere. There is the possibility of using our own server if one can be built to be reilabile. This alone could cost a few hundred dollars and more. On the other hand we could use a hosting site that would be able to do this for us for much cheaper and more reliable. Using a company to host  our site would cost on average anywhere from $80 to $300 per month. Other than this all the APIs and libraries we would use are free to use so no cost in the production stage.
